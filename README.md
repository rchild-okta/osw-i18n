# OSW-I18N

Simple example that demonstrates how to bootstrap the Okta Sign-In Widget with a different locale, using the published i18n labels.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    [osw-i18n]$ npm install
    ```

3. Serve the `osw-i18n` directory using your choice of static server. A good one is [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

    ```bash
    [osw-i18n]$ http-server -p 90001
    ```
    
4. Point your browser to the hosted files. You should be able to choose a locale, and see it render the Okta Sign-In Widget using that locale.
